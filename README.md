typelist
========

Compile-time type lists in C++.
While reading the great [book](http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Design-Generic-Programming-Patterns/dp/0201704315/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1379212101&sr=8-1&keywords=alexandresku) by Andrei Alexandresku I decided it should be a good practice for my template skills and decided to reimplement the typelists he writes about in C++11 and add a little more operations to them (while discarding others). This is what has come of it.
The list of operations is not yet complete. I'm planning to add joins (inner,left,right) union and merge among other thigs.
